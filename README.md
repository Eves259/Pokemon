# Pokemon

Overview-This website has four pages. There is a home page with links to the three other pages. The three other pages display stats for three different evolutions of a pokemon. The information came from a JSON input.

Purpose-The purpose of this project is to practice manipulating JSON objects and displaying it on an HTML document by creating a pokedex for three evolutions of a pokemon.

Languages-This website uses HTML, JS, SCSS, and JSON.

Features-This website contains a slideshow that has images of all of the pokemon, hyperlinks to all other pages, and a consistent fire theme throughout the site. The stats pages include the manipulated JSON object.
