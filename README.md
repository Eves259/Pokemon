# Pokemon

Overview-This website has four pages. There is a home page with links to the three other pages. The three other pages display stats for three different evolutions of a pokemon. The information came from a JSON input.

Purpose-The purpose of this project is to practice manipulating JSON objects and displaying it on an HTML document by creating a pokedex for three evolutions of a pokemon.

Languages-This website uses HTML, JS, SCSS, and JSON.

Features-This website contains a slideshow that has images of all of the pokemon, hyperlinks to all other pages, and a consistent fire theme throughout the site. The home page also includes a way to switch to a dark theme and a way to play music. The stats pages include the manipulated JSON object.

Work Completed for the site
1.The home page for the website was created first (the basic layout of three cards was set up. The cards showing the pokemon and their names was also set up. An SVG background was added and applied to the page. Additional formatting decisions like the slideshow and how to change between slides were made. Final additions were the dark mode and a way to play music.)
2.The JSON input was broken up (The JSON input was broken up and applied to each of the stats pages with an onload function which allowed for the page to apply the proper information to the correct page. Each page is linked to a specific function that is included in one JS file.)
3.Three additional pages were created to show the JSON objects (The stats pages labeled fire-# were created to show the stats for each evolution of the pokemon. Once the information was added it was reformatted to fit the style of the page.)
4.Styles were added to each page (Specfic styles like fonts, button colors, and text color was added to the pages.)
